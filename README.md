The primary motivation for this research project was to investigate the relationship between proximity to military and industrial land, poverty, and the rates of environmental illness in cities within San Diego County, California. Given the significant industrial and military presence in the area, particularly around the Port of San Diego, we hypothesized that both proximity to such areas and poverty would be strong predictors of environmental illness rates. Previous studies have highlighted the health risks associated with living near industrial sites in other cities, prompting us to explore if similar patterns exist in San Diego.

Our analysis revealed an unexpected result: Proximity to military and industrial land was not a statistically significant predictor of environmental illness rates, with a P-value of 0.117. This finding contrasts with existing literature that associates industrial proximity with increased health risks, suggesting that other factors may be mitigating this effect in San Diego County or that there exist socioeconomic factors leading individuals ill with non-fatal conditions in areas more affected by poverty to avoid seeking treatment (thereby skewing the resulting county-wide data).

In contrast, our findings confirmed that poverty is a significant predictor of environmental illness rates. The data showed a strong positive correlation between higher poverty rates and increased instances of environmental illnesses, underscoring the significant impact of socioeconomic status on health outcomes. This highlights the critical role that socioeconomic factors play in environmental health disparities, particularly in low-income cities such as National City.

In conclusion, while proximity to military and industrial areas may not be as influential as previously thought, addressing poverty is crucial for mitigating environmental health disparities in San Diego County. These results call for a comprehensive approach to public health that includes socioeconomic interventions and targeted policies to improve living conditions and healthcare access for impoverished communities, thereby promoting health equity across the region.
