    "In many ways, the Port of San Diego is the city's backbone.  Opened in 1962, it is responsible for bringing everything from Honda automobiles to passengers aboard cruise ships into the city.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)  While the heavy industry and tourism enabled by the port contributed to transforming what was a small military town into America's eighth largest city within a generation<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), it does not come without its own drawbacks.  De Roos et. al. have shown that residential areas near industrial sites in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Detroit are all at greater risk of health complications such as lymphoma, lung disease, and other environmental diseases.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)  However, they also showed that the rate of occurrence for these complications varies not only with proximity to an industrial site, but the type of goods produced at each industrial site as well.  In particular, individuals living within half a mile of industrial plants producing rubber, refining metal, or processing chemicals are over twice as likely to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma versus individuals who do not.  In a similar vein, a 2023 report on water pollution from PFAS and other \"forever chemicals\" traced back to dumping on military bases suggests a similarly bleak picture for residents in affected areas being over twice as likely to develop kidney, testicular, or prostate cancer.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)  Ultimately, reports such as these lead to the same question:  Does the Port of San Diego and its nearby industrial plants bring about similar health concerns for San Diegans?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is a novel one because much of the discussion around environmental illness in San Diego revolves around sewage flow northward from Mexico.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)  While this has been directly linked with a number of gastrointestinal complications particularly in the South San Diego Bay<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6), this means that other environmental hazards are comparatively under-researched.  There have been several high-profile cases -- fumigation of methyl bromide pesticide affecting liver and kidney health in Barrio Logan residents starting in the 1990s<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7), as well as diesel particulate matter causing air quality concerns in Barrio Logan and Logan Heights<a name=\"cite_ref-8\"></a>[<sup>8</sup>](#cite_note-8) -- but a comprehensive understanding of the role of the port, heavy industry, and military bases on local communities' health is largely absent.  One factor that remains constant between existing analyses is the socioeconomic status and racial makeup of affected neighborhoods.  Residents of Barrio Logan, over 80% of whom are Latino, experience some of the highest rates of poverty in San Diego.<a name=\"cite_ref-9\"></a>[<sup>9</sup>](#cite_note-9)  As a result, the lack of comprehensive data analysis on environmental illness in such neighborhoods is actively detrimental to health of its residents.\n",

    "We predict that there will be a strong correlation between neighborhoods' proximity to the Port of San Diego (as well as Naval Base San Diego) and rates of lung disease, cancer, and other environmental illnesses.  These rates will be connected to high-profile environmental disruptions -- such as methyl bromide fumigation mentioned above -- but will be more readily explained by less egregious yet more consistent pollutants.  We expect to find this relationship between proximity and illness strongest among neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty, such as Barrio Logan, Logan Heights, and National City.  Conversely, we also expect to find lower rates of illness in wealthier neighborhoods even if they are in close proximity to the port and naval base (such as Gaslamp Quarter and Marina)."

    "Because our project analyzes medical diagnosis data, it is our ethical responsibility to ensure that our data is fully anonymized and stripped of any identifying information.  While our question revolves around the neighborhoods where individuals live (a piece of information which is inherently identifying), neighborhoods are a granular enough region that properly-anonymized diagnosis data would not pose an ethical concern for our project.  In addition, our initial search for data yielded a variety of datasets originating from area hospitals.  However, seriously ill patients who are unable to access medical resources (likely due to financial constraints and lack of insurance coverage) will be left off of such datasets.  This means that our analyses may unfairly skew away from neighborhoods and communities that are traditionally underserved by medical resources, defeating the goal of our analysis.  This possibility of bias in our data means that it is our responsibility to detect and correct it during our analysis, primarily by ensuring our sample sizes are sufficiently large and our analyses are performed in a way that accounts for this bias.  Ultimately, our main privacy concern relates to anonymized medical data, while our main ethical concern relates to analyzing this data while remaining mindful of the socioeconomic biases it may contain."
